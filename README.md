# Project Description:
The HeartTrack application is a low-cost IoT enabled web app for monitoring heart rate and blood oxygen saturation level throughout the day at a user (or physicians) rate. The IoT device uses a heart rate and oxygen sensor and will periodically remind users to take heart rate and blood oxygen saturation level measurements. The IoT device will transmit measurements to a web application through which users (or physicians) can view their data. Supports a weekly summary view and detailed day view.

Application hosted on AWS linux machine and for server side utilized JavaScript, Node.js and
the Express framework.

This Node.js web application employed NoSQL database (MongoDB) to store user data.
