# Project Description:
The HeartTrack application is a low-cost IoT enabled web app for monitoring heart rate and blood oxygen saturation level throughout the day at a user (or physicians) rate. The IoT device uses a heart rate and oxygen sensor and will periodically remind users to take heart rate and blood oxygen saturation level measurements. The IoT device will transmit measurements to a web application through which users (or physicians) can view their data. Supports a weekly summary view and detailed day view.
